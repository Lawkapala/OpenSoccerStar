  Welcome to Open Soccer Star!

  In Open Soccer Star you start a career as a young and talented soccer player. First you need to train a lot to improve your skills and get only a few minutes of play time at a low level team. But as your skill improves, you will get offers from better teams. The press will get aware of you and you start giving interviews. Sign personal sponsor contracts and improve your living standard.
  Your coach plays a defensive system, but your true value comes into play when you are set as a full forward? Ally with your team mates and denigrate the coach at the press and the team's management. If that works out, you get a new trainer - if not you have a real problem now.
  Open Soccer Star is all about a soccer player's life. It's all about the community. And it's built by the community.
